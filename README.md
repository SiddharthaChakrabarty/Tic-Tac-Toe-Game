# Tic_Tac_Toe_Game
Tic Tac Toe is a two player game. In this game, there is a board with 3 x 3 squares on it

The two players take turns putting marks(either X or O) on the 3 x 3 board. The goal of the game is to be the first player to get three same symbols in a row - either horizontally, vertically or diagonally on the 3 x 3 board. The player who first gets three of his symbols in a row - vertically, horizontally, or diagonally wins the game, while the other player loses the game. This project is meant to be played by two players sitting on the same computer.
